Simple script for backing up iDevice backups made via iTunes

By default, iTunes only stores the most recent backup you've made. Sometimes, you want to have multiple backups stored. This script just makes the task of copying the backup directory a bit simpler.

Out of the box, run the script and it will copy the last backup iTunes made into ~/idevice-backup-backup/[current date].
